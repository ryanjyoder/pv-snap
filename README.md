# pv-snap
pv (snap) - monitor the progress of data through a pipe

## Why not install the deb?
If your running Ubuntu Core, you can't install deb packages. Also if you were particularly security concious, you might like running it in a sandbox.


## Description
pv  shows  the  progress  of  data through a pipeline by giving information such as time elapsed, percentage completed (with progress bar), current throughput rate, total data transferred, and ETA.

To use it, insert it in a pipeline between two processes, with the appropriate options.  Its standard input will be passed through to its standard output and progress will be shown on standard error.
